# Companions Pay – Impact Wallet & Umrah Rewards Platform

Companions Pay is a purpose-driven financial app built for Muslims saving toward Umrah and Hajj. It allows users to top up with real money, earn Ihram Credits (IC), and redeem for faith-based goals or spiritual impact actions — like planting trees in Madinah, gifting Qurans, or sponsoring Umrah for others.
